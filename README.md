# geek-life
Welcome to my Geek-Life repo.

Throughout this repo I will learn and explore Git and GitHub. As a long-time web developer I am familiar with version control but still fairly new to using it in a team environment.

In this repo, I will be expanding my knowledge and preparing myself for real-world applications of Git and GitHub.
